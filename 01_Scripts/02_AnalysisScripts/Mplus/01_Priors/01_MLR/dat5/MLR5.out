     THE MODEL ESTIMATION DID NOT TERMINATE NORMALLY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE
     LOGLIKELIHOOD DURING THE LAST E STEP.

     AN INSUFFICENT NUMBER OF E STEP ITERATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN USED.  INCREASE
     THE NUMBER OF MITERATIONS OR INCREASE THE MCONVERGENCE VALUE.  ESTIMATES
     CANNOT BE TRUSTED.
     SLOW CONVERGENCE DUE TO PARAMETER 12.
